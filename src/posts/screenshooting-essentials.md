I've been recently building a great deal of docs, and found myself making a
huge ton of screenshots. These are essential to not only showcase your product,
but to make it easier for everyone to find buttons, menus and alike.

Here are some rough guidelines I've come to realize when making screenshots,
to make them sharp, lightweight and interesting.

## Screenshooting tools

- Default OS tool
- Cleanshot
- Shottr

Starting with the tools to use, I recommend honing in to whatever tool that allows your
workflow to be as seamless and convenient as possible. The OS level screenshot tool
is usually a good place to start.

As per my choices, being a macOS user, my tool of choice is undoubtedly [Shottr](https://shottr.cc/).

## Composition over annotation

- it's better to focus on the right thing than adding 20 arrows and rectangles

## Context matters

- compose your screenshot so it's understandable

## Zoom in!

- zooming in will guarantee maximum sharpness
- two types of zoom:
  - âŒ˜ + `+`
    - usually scales the font size up
  - pinch to zoom (macOS)
    - behaves more like actually zooming in, respecting proportions

## Hover states

- use hover states as native highlighting

## Compress your screenshots

- PNGs can come as quite big files
- Compress to web native formats, like webp
  - usually webp images are ~15-20% of the original size
