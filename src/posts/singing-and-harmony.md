Some days ago (since the creation of this post) I uploaded a new video which I am very proud of. It is a song cover by [El Jose](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2bYHojIdnEKALvN2TZ3zrP?si=lXXM84jnTNCuKajT7w2T5Q&dl_branch=1) and [El Kanka](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4Byu6VBhuMYzcoIUrIyLuL?si=nBOdyT1dQYm8mwjG6VwMtg&dl_branch=1), two andalusian singers and songwriters known for their incredible taste in mixing modern elements with the traditional andalusian sound. You can check the original song [here](https://open.spotify.com/track/2yvUa42t8I1vSTn51Ex29r?si=8e2873f3fa7148f3), but I much prefer [this live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLGqlcv0yUQ), more raw version.

My take on it was much more influenced by the second option as you may see. I went for the same exact sound: just voice and my lovely guitalele.

When finished, I thought I would add some more voices to spicy it up. I might have gone a bit too far, but honestly I regret nothing. There is nothing I love more than singing and even more so if it means reharmonizing a beautiful song such as this one.

Anyways, here you have my version. Hope you enjoy it!
