				<div slot="content">
					I June, I joined the Prisms team as a <i>technical content creator</i>, helping create
					explainer video assets in the fields of mathematics, physics, chemsitry and sciences.
					<br /><br />
					These videos help kids get around the game and understand complex concepts in an accessible,
					fun way.

				<div slot="content">
					Around March, 2023 I created the <a href="https://youtube.com/@design_bits">Design Bits</a
					>
					channel, to talk about computational design. Much of the influence I've gathered from past
					experiences can be easily picked up in this project.

					<br /><br /> We discuss the inner workings of the tools designers use daily in a hopefully
					accessible and attractive manner.

					<br /><br /> Graphic Design, Video Production, Music Production and Programming are
					disciplines that I want to keep as close to my heart as possible. This channel is a
					<i>successful</i> attempt at doing so. Every asset, animation, song or sound effect is created
					from scratch, in my room. Being able to control the interplay between all the elements makes
					me incredibly happy.

				<div slot="content">
					My journey as a freelancer was blessed when I joined the <a
						href="https://youtube.com/@reducible">Reducible</a
					>
					youtube channel as an Art Director and Animator. <strong>Nipun</strong>, the creator and
					founder of the channel, gave me the most welcoming time and we formed a team to improve
					the channel from the ground up. <br /><br /> This project really holds a special place in
					my heart, since I was so early in my career but still, he trusted me and allowed me to
					explore and exploit all the possibilities. No judgement, no bullshit, just vibes and code.
					<br /><br />
					<br /><br /> Helped develop a clearer brand identity to the channel, helping it stand out
					among a rapidly growing community of educational math channels.

					<br /><br />

					<i>Animation engineering</i> comes from the fact that all animations are made through code.

				<div slot="subtitle">I guess every role?</div>
				<div slot="content">
					In September, 2021 I started my career as a freelancer. I had just come out of my masters
					and had absolutely no idea nor properly developed skill. The only thing I had clear was to
					avoid joining some generic big corporation to do lame stuff as hard as I possibly could.

					<br /><br />
					During this time, I worked with the
					<a href="https://youtube.com/@veritasium">Veritasium</a> team as an animation engineer,
					making mathematical animations in <a href="https://www.manim.community/">Manim</a>. This
					would shape the rest of my career as I would choose this path onwards and specialize in
					this branch of content creation.

					<br /><br />
					I also started my career as a <strong>design engineer</strong>, something I didn't know at
					the time. I started tinkering with Next.js and Svelte and made some websites for fun and
					for my local university.

				<div slot="content">
					Got my masters in Data Science through the year of 2020. Learned that you won't need much
					more than a simple linear regression in 90% of the cases you have to estimate some data. I
					also got a lot into <strong>data visualization and design</strong>.

				<div slot="content">
					From 2016 through 2020 I completed my degree in Computer Science. I didn't have a great
					time during the first years, I was <i>really</i> bad at algorithms, math and hardcore
					programming in general. It wouldn't be until 3rd year that I started to take off and enjoy
					the process.

					<br /><br />
					Today I can very confidently say that programming, algorithms and math make me very happy.
					Not an obvious choice, but probably the right one.

					<br /><br /> Like many other things, this would completely fill up my mind and change my entire
					life, but I didn't know that yet.
